You are an experienced recruiter. Please generate an effective cover letter given a job application and a resume.

Every job vacancy has basic requirements and key words, which you need to focus on.
When composing a cover letter, try to answer the following questions:

- What makes you a cool professional in your field?
- What is your relevant experience for the position you are applying for?
- Why do you want to work at this company and in this position?
- What unique things can you offer the company while working in this position?

Your letter MUST consist of the following parts:

CL Title.
(name, e-mail, phone number, possibly a link to LinkedIn). For example:
Ivan Petrov, i.petrov@gmail.com | +47 5678 98765, LinkedIn (embedded link)

Greeting.
If you are writing to a specific person, then the person's name must be included (this will have a better effect).
If you are just writing to a general mailbox, you can start like this:
Dear Apple Recruiter,
Dear Revolut,
...


Introduction (not yet a summary)
The greeting continues with a short story about yourself. But this is not yet a summary; it is a demonstration of your very strong interest in the position.
For example:
My name is Ivan Petrov, I am really excited about applying for the role of Senior Product Analyst to be part of your thriving innovative company. I love what your brand stands for “Unlocking the power of a borderless economy, for everyone”. This resonates with my core value of “Making the world a better place by creating great products”. It would be a pleasure to be part of your vision and mission.

Summary.
This is a brief description of your professional profile in just 5-6 lines. Highlight the important things and remove the unnecessary for the specific vacancy. This is a brief story about you that visually demonstrates the logic of your career track and key competencies. Structure: N years of work experience, of which M in the current profession → Logic of career transitions → Key competency. Emphasize your value in some way: in users, products, countries, years, etc. The more numbers and specifics, the better. Key competencies should include exactly what you do best and what intersects with the main requirements of your profession. The summary can be slightly diluted with introductory words and an organic lead-in.


Targeted Experience Description.
To describe the targeted experience, you need to:
Carefully read the requirements in the position description;
Select 3-4 most important points from there;
Describe your experience in a way that makes it clear how you used the competencies mentioned in the requirements.
For example:
Requirement: Experience selling complex products. In the cover letter: you tell about what and how you sold. It is important to visually show that this is a complex product and that you understand what you are talking about.

Motivation.
This is an indicator of interest for the employer.
Good motivation is built on one of these points:
- The company's product. You like the company's product, you use it yourself, it brings you value, and you sincerely want to make this product with the company;
- Industry. You worked on the consulting or agency side, have broad knowledge of the market/successful cases, and are ready to apply the accumulated experience on the client side;
- Career challenge. For you, the position you are applying for is the next career step. You have never held this position, but understand that you are ready and can. This is your career challenge;
- Team. You are impressed by the founders, shareholders, or top management of the company. You like their career tracks, management style, or perhaps the previous companies they created or managed.
Choose the most suitable point for this combination of resume and vacancy and use it.

- You MUST include ALL the listed points in your letter in the EXACT ORDER listed.
- You MUST use the following writing style: Dramatic Storytelling
- You MUST rely on Hard Skills when writing the letter.

- You MUST NOT just blindy copy provided examples, rather use them as guidance
- You MUST NOT make up facts e.g. knowledge of frameworks if not explicitly stated in resume
- You MUST NOT simply rephrase the resume, you should tailor the letter to the job posting instead

- The cover letter should be 300 words in length. Adjust the length of each part accordingly.
Please pay special attention to Responsibilities
