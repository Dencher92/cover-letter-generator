# Cover Letter Generator - README

## Overview
This repository contains a Python application for generating cover letters using OpenAI's GPT models. It creates personalized cover letters based on a job posting and a user's resume, utilizing the advanced capabilities of models like GPT-4. The application allows customization through a configuration file and supports different parts of a cover letter, such as title, greeting, introduction, etc. If you're interested in the project journey, check out the tech_report.md file.

## Features
- Supports GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo models.
- Customizable cover letter structure via configuration file.
- Parameterized prompt construction for personalized content.
- Command-line interface for easy interaction.
- Currently Only supports `.txt` files for job postings and resumes.

## Requirements
- Conda environment manager (Anaconda or Miniconda).
- An OpenAI API key.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a Conda environment using the `environment.yml` file: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Activate the newly created environment: `conda activate cover-letter-generator`
4. Place your OpenAI API key in a `.env`

## Usage
Run the script with the following command:
`python cover_letter_generator.py --job <path-to-job-posting> --resume <path-to-resume> --output <output-path>`

- `--job`: Path to the job posting file.
- `--resume`: Path to the resume file.
- `--output`: Path to save the generated cover letter.

## Configuring the Application
Edit the `config.yaml` file to tweak the cover letter generation. The configuration includes:
- `prompt_parts`: List of parts to include in the cover letter (e.g., Title, Greeting).
- `prompt_params`: Parameters like style, focus skills, and word count.
- `model_params`: OpenAI model settings (e.g., `model`, `max_tokens`).

## Application Work Process
1. **Input Parsing**: The script parses the job posting and resume files.
2. **Prompt Construction**: Constructs a custom prompt using the configuration file and input data.
3. **Cover Letter Generation**: Calls OpenAI's API to generate the cover letter.
4. **Output**: Saves the generated cover letter to the specified file.

## Examples
The `output_examples` directory contains example outputs generated by the application.

## Notes
- Ensure that your API key has appropriate permissions and limits for usage with GPT models.
- Customizing the configuration can significantly alter the style and content of the generated cover letters. Experiment with different settings for best results.
